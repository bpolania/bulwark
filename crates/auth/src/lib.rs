//! Bulwark auth — OAuth 2.1 / OIDC authentication for Bulwark sessions.
//!
//! This crate handles OIDC token exchange, JWKS validation, group mapping,
//! and claim extraction. It produces [`MappedClaims`] that the caller uses
//! to create Bulwark sessions — session creation itself is not this crate's
//! responsibility.
